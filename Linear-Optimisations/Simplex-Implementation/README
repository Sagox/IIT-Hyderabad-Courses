2) Sai Harsha - CS17BTECH11036

---------------------
Assumptions
---------------------
1) I have assumed that the positivity constraints i.e. Xi >= 0 would
be given within A, i.e. -Xi <= 0. As this is the case that was taught
in the class.
2) Since the accuracy is limited to floatin point arithmetic, values
like 43.2e-13 should be understood as zero in the output.

---------------------
Example Run of the code
---------------------
For quick example run of the code please use the following commands:

cat input.txt | python3 simplex.py

cat degenerate-input.txt | python3 degenrateSimplex.py

---------------------
Directory Information
---------------------
The following files are present in this folder:
1) simplex.py - simplex implementation for non-degenerate case
2) degenerateSimplex.py - simplex implementation which can handle degenerate case as well
3) input.txt - test case for simplex.py
4) degenerate-input.txt - test case for degenerateSimplex.py
5) unbounded.txt - test case for unbounded LP
it can be run using:
cat unbounded.txt | python3 degenrateSimplex.py

---------------------
Expected Input Format
---------------------
1) First line m
2) Second line n
3) Next m lines, value of A row wise space seperated
4) Values of B space seperated
5) Values of C space seperated

Please look at the provided example input filess
